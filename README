This is a README for my Linux Basic Socket regarding echo_s, echo_c, and log_s

This mini-project showcases my knowledge on Networking & Sockets within a Linux environment
- It connects a client and a server uilizing a socket
- Allows for both TCP & UDP 
- The client is able to input data
- Multiple clients may input at once, so long as the ports are not full
- The logger will write all entries to a logfile

To Compile:
- Simply run the command: make (The make file titled "Makefile" will compile everything
- If needed you can easily delete everything by running the command: make clean (deletes all .o modules, executables, and the log file)
To run:

For logger log_s:
- You can choose to run in the background using: ./leg_s & (This will allow you to use this terminal to view the echo.log after the next steps) 
- Or just run in the foreground (No & after the script execution statement) --> Please use a separate window

For echo_s
- Open another terminal window and execute ./echo_s <port> [<port2> <port3>]
- A message will output saying that the server has started up
- To exit CTRL-Z, and you can kill after viewing jobs

For echo_c
- Open another terminal window and execute ./echo_c 127.0.0.1 <port> [<port2> <port3>] <Connection Type>  "Message Encased in Quotes"
- Type either 'tcp' or 'udp' for the connection Type
- Once the program starts you can type your message

To Check if the echo.log captured the output just do cat echo.log
